Which activation function is used in the final layer of the generator model?--tanh

 best describes the role of the generator in a GAN?- produces images

What is used to refine the models during training?- Adam optimizer

In the discriminator's code, which layer helps in reducing the dimensions of the input image-- Conv2D with strides

In the generator code, what is the purpose of the Reshape layer?--To reshape the dense layer into a 3D tensor for images

Which technique can help in dealing with training instability in GANs-- gradiant chipping

Which architecture can help address convergence issues in traditional GANs- WGAN

During training, what does the generator use to improve itself- feedback from discriminator
